# PSA Celebrates Groundbreaking for its New Supply Chain Hub,

# Pioneering an Integrated Logistics Ecosystem in Singapore

PSA Singapore (PSA) has unveiled the PSA Supply Chain Hub @ Tuas (PSCH), a central part of
its strategic expansion within Tuas Port, at its groundbreaking ceremony today. This state-of-the-art
facility, scheduled to be ready by 2027, is poised to transform the logistics and supply chain
landscape in Singapore.

Strategically situated next to Tuas Port within the Free Trade Zone, the PSCH will be seamlessly
integrated with Singapore’s extensive supply chain ecosystem, offering unparalleled connectivity
and scale as a Regional Distribution Centre and a Container Freight Station. Its comprehensive suite
of value-added services and the supply chain synergies it creates will further strengthen Singapore’s
position as a global logistics and supply chain powerhouse.

Spanning more than two million square feet, PSCH will be equipped with cutting-edge technologies
such as advanced robotics and automation systems, including the Automated Storage and Retrieval
Systems (ASRS) and the Intelligent Warehouse eXchange (iWX) (see Annex A for more details of
these technologies). These innovations are designed to meet the evolving needs of modern supply
chains, providing customers with enhanced visibility, streamlined processes and the agility needed
to adapt to an ever-changing global market.

The hub also embodies PSA’s steadfast commitment to sustainability, incorporating eco-friendly
features such as renewable energy sources, sustainable drainage systems and energy-efficient
designs. These measures are aligned with PSA’s broader goal of achieving net-zero emissions,
further advancing and supporting Singapore’s smooth transition into a green and sustainable future.

Mr Peter Voser, Group Chairman of PSA International, said, “The PSA Supply Chain Hub @ Tuas
(PSCH) is strategically positioned to create exceptional synergy with Tuas Port and it will be
instrumental in enhancing value capture within the port and supply chain ecosystem. This new hub
is well-positioned to support not only Singapore’s trade and logistics sector, but also the wider
Southeast Asia region and beyond. PSCH will be Singapore’s gateway to the world. Along with
PSA’s expanding suite of port adjacencies solutions, we are making significant progress towards
realising our vision of building a more connected and sustainable end-to-end supply chain
ecosystem.”

Mr Ong Kim Pong, Group CEO of PSA International, said, “Rapidly evolving global trade patterns
require us to rethink our business strategy and model. While we continue to secure our positions in
key locations, we also need to connect our strategic nodes to form a cohesive and integrated
network, in alignment with our Node to Network strategy. With the PSA Supply Chain Hub @ Tuas
on board, our collective strength and synergy will enable PSA to harness the full potential of our
combined port and wider logistics network to deliver unmatched efficiency and reliability in service


routes and networks. PSA will continue to expand our fabric of port networks and supply chain
services in a sustainable way, adding value and enhancing cargo flows. Our deepest appreciation
goes out to our unions, stakeholders and partners, whose unwavering support has been instrumental
in making this vision a reality.”

The development of the PSCH builds upon PSA’s extensive experience in port adjacencies
ecosystem, including the management of PSA Keppel Distripark - a multi-tenanted cargo distribution
complex specialising in the consolidation and deconsolidation of Less than Container Load cargo.
Together with the city terminals at Tanjong Pagar, Keppel and Brani, operations at Keppel Distripark
will also be consolidated at Tuas Port by 2027.
